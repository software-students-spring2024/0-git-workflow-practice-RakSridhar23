# NYU SWE INTRO TO GIT

This project is an introduction to github and git workflow practice. There is a link to an interesting article (IMO) on software engineering and why it is interesting.

## Read this article!!

[Interesting Article](https://anthony-dandrea.medium.com/the-value-of-having-no-strong-opinion-in-software-engineering-26bea1ebc181)

 - I find this article intriguing because it delves into the nuanced world of opinions in software engineering, emphasizing the impact opinions have on design, implementation, and overall career growth. The piece skillfully navigates the progression of engineers from lacking strong opinions to developing and leveraging them for career advancement. What particularly caught my attention is the exploration of the value in not having a strong opinion, especially when dealing with less-than-critical decisions. The author's witty call back to the article title, humorously suggesting a more accurate but verbose alternative, adds a touch of lightheartedness to the complex subject. As someone who often grapples with the challenge of balancing opinions in collaborative environments, the article provides valuable insights into how embracing a "No Strong Opinion" stance can contribute to efficient decision-making, team dynamics, and individual growth in the software engineering realm.

 - Firas: What I find interesting about this article is this larger discussion on how your opinion is 'allowed' to form a stronger opinion as you progress and 'mature' as a software engineer--and in situations where it is essential for you to hold strong, decisive opinions. However, as you are arriving at that point, by not grounding yourself in a strong opinion, you allow yourself to freely and dynamically develop your programming habits, opinions, and tendencies; mentally, you do not block yourself away from certain programming frameworks, workflows, etc. (it is much more preferable to 'flow like water'). I could certainly see extensions of what the article evaluated to my own (potential) future experiences working on the various projects of this course; I can eprceive how a strong-headed opinion may imepede me as I begin this journey into effective Software Engineering and, more pertinently, explore how I can adapt to varying team dynamics, expectations, and opinions.
